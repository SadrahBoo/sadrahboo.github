    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>A model to show hopefully the function of the mystery box is most likely to match the real mystery black box. The function, leakage, tube use, possible buckets or bins.</p>

<h1>Evidence</h1>
<p>The mystery black box is a black instrument-like box that is locked and drains + pours water out. 
The initial observations/data about the mystery black box was that sometimes the mystery box input remains the same in the output of water. For example on trial 11 Mr. Sinusas poured 500ml (input) then the output was 500ml. However our group's model wasn’t the same. The pattern remains the same on my team’s mystery box; we pour an amount and like about 50-100 is cut off of ml. There is an outlier though, on the last trial we poured 200ml and nothing came out. My model’s key structure was buckets and tubes. The function was that when you pour water it goes down a squiggly tube to a bucket which fills until it touches a short tube to another bucket to another output. It gives a similar result of water coming out the output often but not right away,  sometimes with no water coming out. We tested our model by simply pouring water into our funnel. (Results are shown throughout the evidence).
</p>

<h1>Reasoning Part I</h1>
<p>A model is something like the real function (anything), a model can sometimes match the real function. The real structure has more strength but some limitations because we are using the model to test if it can go past the limits. Our box is mostly cardboard which makes it hard to compare with an instrument-like case. So a model is more likely to be more complex than the real structure. Like for example the real mystery black box is the real function, it is hollow (from when I knocked on it) it is light and doesn’t make any noise. It is similar to our model, but ours might be more than what the real structure is because the more function inside our box the more efficient.</p>

<h1>Reasoning Part II</h1>
<p>Our mystery box most of the time has sometimes fair output like the real box. Usually the real mystery black box has the output to be not an outlier to its own input. The real mystery box is really silent when the water gets poured inside, and when my group used tubing the really most silent part was the tubing.
</p>

<h1>Reasoning Part III</h1>
<p>The data would’ve been different if there was more use/abundance of different materials or just similar but just for another use.</p>
